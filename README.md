Cryptography-with-Python
========================

##Note: This code is from when I was ten. It's not very good.

Some codes I was playing around with :)
Check out the vengioner one that one works the best
The code replaces the letters from text with a key. Each letter of the key is a different caeser shift. I think it's called vengioner encryption. Vengioner is probably spelled different.   
SECURITY RATING OF ENCRYPTION -- This is sort of secure -_-
